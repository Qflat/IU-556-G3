    "The HCDR project is designed to tackle the problem of accurately predicting which applicants will default on their home credit loan. Phase 2 focuses on establishing a foundational understanding of the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and developing baseline machine-learning pipelines using the HCDR datasets. The primary goal of Phase 2 was to explore the structure and quality of the datasets to identify missing patterns and key correlations that will influence the model’s performance. Evaluation metrics were defined in LaTeX and interpreted to clarify how each metric reflects model behavior. Then, baseline pipelines were implemented using subsets of the data. The pipelines included logistic regression, random forest, LGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The results demonstrate that the LightGBM pipeline is the best model as of now, which can continue to be improved during Phase 3."

    "The HCDR Project is important because it allows Home Credit to accurately predict which clients will repay the loan. It looks at several variables to increase accuracy. We hypothesize that machine learning pipelines with feature engineering can accurately predict the repayment of a loan. In this phase, we performed EDA, created basic pipelines, and evaluated results based on key metrics. The results are significant because they establish realistic baselines for model performance and highlight which variables and preprocessing steps are most likely to influence prediction accuracy. These findings help us understand where the current approach succeeds, where it struggles, and what areas will benefit most from deeper feature engineering and tuning. In Phase 3, we plan to build on the pipelines by continuing feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, including additional feature selection, as well as using ensemble methods. Overall, Phase 2 has provided the foundation for further improvement in predictions."
