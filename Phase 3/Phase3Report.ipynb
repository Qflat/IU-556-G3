    "During Phase 3 of the HCDR Project, the team is focused on enhancing the models designed in Phase 2. The problems being tackled included models that are not performing at a optimal level, based on metrics such as F1 score and accuracy. The models produced in Phase 2 are not ideal for predicting which clients will default on a home credit loan. Thus, the goal of Phase 3 is to produce better predictions by performing additional feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. In Phase 3, the team also performed feature selection based on a analysis of the importance of the features. An ensemble method was also used to enhance the model pipelines. The ensemble model has had the best performance. It is better than the logistic regression, tuned random forest, and random forest pipelines. The best score our team has produced is the 0.762 from the ensemble pipeline. "

    "Feature engineering was performed to improve the predictions the models were producing. It is important to perform feature engineering to provide the training data with additional features that can be used to optimize the model. Appropriate feature engineering can provide a positive impact to the model. However, the features selected must be correlated to the loan default target variable to have a significant impact on the model. In Phase 3, the team added features for recency, frequency, and monetary, as stated in the data lineage section. This approach was chosen becasue RFM metrics tend to be vital indicators of how a customer may behave. As mentioned in the Canvas assignment, each feature can disclose a customer's lifetime value, retention, or engagement. All of which are important to consider when reviewing loan applications."

    "Our modeling pipeline combined feature engineering, model tuning, and ensemble learning to improve loan repayment prediction. We began by creating Recency, Frequency, and Monetary features from the bureau dataset, then merged them into the application data to expand the behavioral signal available to the model. After preprocessing and imputing missing values, we tuned a Random Forest model using RandomizedSearchCV to explore variations in tree count, depth, and split thresholds. This process allowed us to evaluate multiple configurations through cross-validation and select a more stable model. We then introduced a soft-voting ensemble that combined Logistic Regression with the tuned Random Forest to capture both linear patterns and more complex nonlinear relationships. Finally, we reviewed feature importance scores to understand which inputs had the strongest influence on predictions and to validate the usefulness of the engineered RFM features."

Although the tuned random forest model had the best single model, the ensemble model had a better overall ROC_AUC score.

    "Although these results represent a meaningful improvement over the baseline Logistic Regression model, they still fall short of the leaderboard benchmark of 0.795. This gap suggests that the pipeline may benefit from more expressive models or richer feature sets, especially around installment and credit-use behavior. Some likely improvements can be gradient boosting and installment features. Ensemble methods appears to be working well. Logistic regression and default hyperparameters had the lowest ROC AUC, so hyperparameter tuning has performed well enough to improve our models."

    "This project focused on building an effective machine learning pipeline to predict loan repayment outcomes using the HCDR dataset. Our goal was to test whether custom feature engineering and systematic model tuning could improve predictive accuracy. The results support this hypothesis: RFM features added valuable behavioral insight, and the tuned models consistently outperformed simpler baselines. These findings highlight the importance of feature quality and model selection when working with credit-risk data. While our current best model performs well, we see opportunities for further improvement through gradient boosting methods, deeper hyperparameter searches, and expanded behavioral features. In future work, we will refine these approaches and prepare the model for a more production-ready deployment."
